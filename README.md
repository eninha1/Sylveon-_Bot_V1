Additional Features:
Playlist Support: When you play a playlist URL, the bot will automatically add all songs to the queue
Queue Management: Songs are played in order, and you can skip through them
Auto-Reconnect: The bot will automatically join your voice channel if needed when you use the play command
Notes:
The bot uses ! as its prefix (you can change this by modifying the PREFIX variable in the code)
The bot requires you to be in a voice channel to use any audio-related commands
For best results, provide direct video URLs rather than search terms.
